    "# QUESTION.1 What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle in python.\n",
    "# ANSWER Multthreading in python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process.Each thread\n",
    "# operates independently, sharing the same resources like memory space, file handles, etc.It's used to archieve parallelism\n",
    "# and improve the perfomanc of program by allowing them to execute multiple tasks simultaneously.\n",

    "# QUESTION.5 state advantages and disadvantages of multithreading.\n",
    "# ANSWER Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Improved Performance:\n",
    "#Multithreading can lead to better utilization of available CPU cores, resulting in faster execution of tasks.\n",
    "#It is particularly effective for applications that involve parallelizable tasks, such as multimedia processing\n",
    "#, data analysis, and simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Responsiveness:\n",
    "#Multithreading can enhance the responsiveness of applications by allowing certain tasks to run in the background while the \n",
    "#main thread handles user interactions.\n",
    "#This is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience in applications like GUIs and games.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Resource Sharing:\n",
    "#Threads within the same process can easily share data and resources, reducing the overhead of inter-process communication.\n",
    "#This can lead to efficient utilization of memory and other system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Multithreaded programming is inherently more complex than single-threaded programming.\n",
    "#Race conditions, deadlocks, and synchronization issues can arise if not properly managed, making debugging and maintenance\n",
    "#challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Synchronization Overhead:\n",
    "#Coordinating threads and ensuring data consistency often requires synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and \n",
    "#barriers.\n",
    "#These mechanisms introduce overhead and can negatively impact performance if used excessively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Debugging and Testing:\n",
    "#Debugging multithreaded applications can be difficult due to the non-deterministic nature of thread execution."

    "# QUESTION.6 Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "# ANSWER Deadlock:\n",
    "#A deadlock is a situation in which two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because they are each waiting for a\n",
    "#resource that the other holds. In other words, they become stuck in a state of mutual waiting, and none of them can make any\n",
    "#progress. Deadlocks can occur when the following conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode, meaning only one process can use it at a time.\n",
    "#Hold and Wait: A process must be holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources.\n",
    "#No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process; they can only be released voluntarily.\n",
    "#Circular Wait: A circular chain of two or more processes must exist, where each process is waiting for a resource held by the\n",
    "#next process in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing or order of execution of multiple threads or processes. It's a situation where the output of a program becomes unpredictable because the threads are \"racing\" to access and modify shared resources without proper synchronization. Race conditions can result in incorrect values, crashes, or other unexpected behavior."
